    <div class="card-text">
		<p>🌺 Milan and Yori set out on a beautiful spring day, eager to go for a walk and explore the countryside 🌲. They had heard about a hidden altar in the forest, and were determined to find it 🔎🕵️‍♀️</p>
	</div>
		<p>As they walked, the sun shone down through the trees 🌞, dappling the forest floor with light 🌻. Milan and Yori chatted and laughed 😁, enjoying each other's company as they followed a winding path through the trees 🌲</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>But as they ventured deeper into the forest 🌲, they started to hear a buzzing sound 🐝. Suddenly, Milan felt a sharp pain on his arm 🤕. "Ow!" he cried out 🗣️, as he looked down to see a bee clinging to his skin 🐝🪐</p>
	</div>
		<p>Yori quickly pulled out a small first aid kit from her backpack 🎒 and tended to Milan's sting 🐝. "Don't worry, I've got you," Yori said comfortingly 👍, as she applied some cream to the wound 🩹</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>As they continued on their walk, Milan and Yori marveled at the tall oak trees that loomed over them 🌳. "Look at the size of those trees!" Milan exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder 🤩</p>
	</div>
		<p>But their peaceful walk was interrupted when they heard a rustling in the bushes 🌿. Suddenly, a group of strange, shadowy creatures emerged from the underbrush 🤖. "Greylings!" Yori shouted 😱, as she grabbed Milan's hand 🤝 and pulled him away from the menacing creatures.</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>The two friends ran as fast as they could 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️, their hearts pounding in their chests 💓. But they were no match for the greylings 🤖, who seemed to be closing in on them from all sides.👻</p>
	</div>
		<p>Just when they thought all was lost 🤯, Milan and Yori stumbled upon a patch of juicy raspberries 🍇. "Quick, let's eat as many of these as we can!" Milan yelled 😋, as he and Yori gobbled up the sweet, red fruit 🍓</p>
		<div class="card-text ">
		<p>The greylings seemed to be confused by the sudden appearance of the raspberries 🤔, and Milan and Yori were able to escape while they were distracted 💨. Exhausted but exhilarated 🤩, they collapsed on the forest floor, giggling and panting 😅</p>
	</div>
		<p>As they caught their breath 💨, they realized that they had lost their way back home 🧭. But they were determined not to let that stop them 💪. "We'll just have to find a new route," Milan said 🛣️, as he and Yori set off on a new adventure 🌎, their bond stronger than ever 🤝</p>

    In Search in the Sea</a>
</p>
<div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="collpoem2">
	<div class="card text-center">

    <div class="card-text">
		<p>Milan and Yori were best friends, and they shared a love for adventure🌎. So, one day they decided to set out on a journey to find a worthy enemy🗡️. They packed their bags🎒 and set off on a boat🚣‍♂️, sailing into the open sea🌊.</p>
	</div>
		<p>The ocean waves were strong🌊 and the winds were high🌬, but Milan and Yori were determined to find their enemy💪. They sailed for days🗓, taking shifts at the helm and keeping watch for any signs of danger🚨.</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>One day, as they were sailing along the coast, they came across a strange creature🐢. It was a giant turtle, and its shell was covered in barnacles🐚. The turtle spoke to them, and it told them that their journey was not meant to be🙏.</p>
	</div>
		<p>Confused and disappointed😔, Milan and Yori decided to sail back home🏠. But they were determined not to let this setback stop them💪. They knew that there were other routes to take🛣️ and other adventures to be had🌲.</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>So, they returned home and set out on a new path🛣️. This time, they were determined to defend their friends from giant trolls🤴 that were roaming the forest🌲. They trained hard💪 and prepared for battle🗡️, knowing that the trolls would not be an easy enemy to defeat.</p>
	</div>
		<p>One day, they came across a group of trolls🤴 and engaged in a fierce battle🗡️. Milan and Yori fought bravely👊, and they emerged victorious🎉. But their journey was far from over. They knew that there were still many more dangers to face🕵️‍♀️.</p>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>As they continued on their adventure, they came across a beautiful, secluded spot in the forest🌳. They set up camp🏕️ and built a small hut, protected by rocks🧱. They spent the night there, basking in the warmth of the fire🔥 and enjoying each other's company🤝.</p>
	</div>
		<p>In the end, Milan and Yori never did find the enemy they were looking for🕵️‍♂️. But they realized that the true adventure was not about the destination🏁, but about the journey itself🛣️. They had each other's backs🤝 and together they faced every challenge that came their way. They returned home empty handed🚫, but with memories and experiences that will last a lifetime💭.</p>
