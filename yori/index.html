    <div class="card-text">
		<p>Milan and Yori set out on a beautiful spring day, eager to go for a walk and explore the countryside. They had heard about a hidden altar in the forest, and were determined to find it.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card text-center text-dark bg-white">
		<p> As they walked, the sun shone down through the trees, dappling the forest floor with light. Milan and Yori chatted and laughed, enjoying each other's company as they followed a winding path through the trees.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>	But as they ventured deeper into the forest, they started to hear a buzzing sound. Suddenly, Milan felt a sharp pain on his arm. "Ow!" he cried out, as he looked down to see a bee clinging to his skin.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text text-dark bg-white ">
		<p>Yori quickly pulled out a small first aid kit from her backpack and tended to Milan's sting. "Don't worry, I've got you," Yori said comfortingly, as she applied some cream to the wound.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>As they continued on their walk, Milan and Yori marveled at the tall oak trees that loomed over them. "Look at the size of those trees!" Milan exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text text-dark bg-white">
		<p>
		But their peaceful walk was interrupted when they heard a rustling in the bushes. Suddenly, a group of strange, shadowy creatures emerged from the underbrush. "Greylings!" Yori shouted, as she grabbed Milan's hand and pulled him away from the menacing creatures.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text">
		<p>The two friends ran as fast as they could, their hearts pounding in their chests. But they were no match for the greylings, who seemed to be closing in on them from all sides.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text text-dark bg-white">
		<p>
		Just when they thought all was lost, Milan and Yori stumbled upon a patch of juicy raspberries. "Quick, let's eat as many of these as we can!" Milan yelled, as he and Yori gobbled up the sweet, red fruit.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="card-text ">
		<p>The greylings seemed to be confused by the sudden appearance of the raspberries, and Milan and Yori were able to escape while they were distracted. Exhausted but exhilarated, they collapsed on the forest floor, giggling and panting.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card-text text-dark bg-white">
		<p>
		As they caught their breath, they realized that they had lost their way back home. But they were determined not to let that stop them. "We'll just have to find a new route," Milan said, as he and Yori set off on a new adventure, their bond stronger than ever.</p>
